            <p>My name is Sara and i'm from Sweden.</p>
            <p>My biggest passion in life is Yoga. 
                But efter spending hours of hours on the mat stretching my spine, 
                drawing my shoulders back and lifting my chest up, I felt it was time for a change.
                 Time to become a true computer geek :)
                So here I am now, hanging over my laptop with a real "Gollum-posture" and squared eyes.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But yes, coding is about to become a true passion. This is my very first webpage, so im a total newbie in this field. 
                But Im hooked!
                What i love most about coding is that it is so creative.
                I also like to challange myself with problem-solving. 
                I really fancy to test new code, re-do it billion and billions of times 
                (which includes the feeling of wanting to throw my computer out the window) 
                and finally get everything as i want it. Then I can collect my reward - this amazing feeling of satisfaction!</p>
